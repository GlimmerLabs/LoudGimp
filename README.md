LoudGimp
========

A Racket library to access Gimp over DBus (requires LoudBus).


To use: Create a clone of both louDBus and gimp-dbus from Glimmer Labs on Github. Navigate to both folders through terminal and type both make and make install-local. Using a racket compiler of your choice, type (require LoudGimp/simplify). All of the wrapper functions in LoudGimp will now be available to use.
 
Organized list of functions forthcoming.
